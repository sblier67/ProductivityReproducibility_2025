  abstract = {Watershed budget studies at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), New Hampshire, USA, have demonstrated high calcium depletion of soil during the 20th century due, in part, to acid deposition. Over the past 25 years, tree growth (especially for sugar maple) has declined on the experimental watersheds at the HBEF. In October 1999, 0.85 Mg Ca/ha was added to Watershed 1 (W1) at the HBEF in the form of wollastonite (CaSiO3), a treatment that, by summer 2002, had raised the pH in the Oie horizon from 3.8 to 5.0 and, in the Oa horizon, from 3.9 to 4.2. We measured the response of sugar maple to the calcium fertilization treatment on W1. Foliar calcium concentration of canopy sugar maples in W1 increased markedly beginning the second year after treatment, and foliar manganese declined in years four and five. By 2005, the crown condition of sugar maple was much healthier in the treated watershed as compared with the untreated reference watershed (W6). Following high seed production in 2000 and 2002, the density of sugar maple seedlings increased significantly on W1 in comparison with W6 in 2001 and 2003. Survivorship of the 2003 cohort through July 2005 was much higher on W1 (36.6\%) than W6 (10.2\%). In 2003, sugar maple germinants on W1 were 50\% larger than those in reference plots, and foliar chlorophyll concentrations were significantly greater (0.27 g/m2 vs. 0.23 g/m2 leaf area). Foliage and fine-root calcium concentrations were roughly twice as high, and manganese concentrations twice as low in the treated than the reference seedlings in 2003 and 2004. Mycorrhizal colonization of seedlings was also much greater in the treated (22.4\% of root length) than the reference sites (4.4\%). A similar, though less dramatic, difference was observed for mycorrhizal colonization of mature sugar maples (56\% vs. 35\%). These results reinforce and extend other regional observations that sugar maple decline in the northeastern United States and southern Canada is caused in part by anthropogenic effects on soil calcium status, but the causal interactions among inorganic nutrition, physiological stress, mycorrhizal colonization, and seedling growth and health remain to be established.},

  abstract = {We examined the health and mycorrhizal colonization       rates of sugar maple germinants on a Calcium (Ca)- treated       watershed at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest and compared       their status to the health of seedlings growing on reference       sites. We quantified general sugar maple germinant health by       height, leaf area, biomass, and chlorophyll content. To       determine vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization       rates, we first cleared and stained germinant roots and then       examined their structures microscopically. We found that       sugar maple seedlings on the Ca-addition site were taller,       had larger leaves, more root, leaf, and stem biomass, and       more chlorophyll per unit leaf area. These seedlings also had       a significantly larger percentage of their roots colonized by       mycorrhizal fungi. Our results indicate a correlation between       soil Ca availability, mycorrhizal colonization rates, and       overall seedling health.       These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook       Ecosystem Study (HBES). The HBES is a collaborative effort at       the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, which is operated and       maintained by the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research       Station.},

  abstract = {To assess potential forest compositional responses to exchangeable soil calcium (Caexch) and aluminum (Alexch), we characterized light-dependent growth and mortality of tree seedlings under amendments of CaCl2 and AlCl3 at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), New Hampshire, U.S.A. Seedlings of Acer saccharum Marsh., Fagus grandifolia Ehrh., Betula alleghaniensis Britton, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., and Picea rubens Sarg. were transplanted into field plots, which were randomly assigned to control, CaCl2, or AlCl3 treatments and stratified across {$<$}1 to 35\% full sun. Acer saccharum and P. rubens exhibited significantly higher mortality in Al-amended than Ca-amended or control plots. Acer saccharum showed significant increases in relative diameter growth in Ca-amended plots versus controls; all other species showed nonsignificantly higher relative diameter growth under Ca amendments. We incorporated significant seedling responses into a model of forest dynamics (SORTIE) to assess potential changes in species composition under Alexch increases and Caexch losses. SORTIE predicts that further increases in Alexch would have negligible effects on canopy composition within 200 years but that the estimated Caexch depleted from HBEF between 1968 and 1995 and its influence on seedling dynamics could lead to substantial decreases in A. saccharum canopy dominance within a single forest generation ({$<$}125 years).}

  abstract = {Decline of sugar maple in North American forests has been attributed to changes in soil calcium (Ca) and nitrogen (N) by acidic precipitation. Although N is an essential and usually a limiting factor in forests, atmospheric N deposition may cause N-saturation leading to loss of soil Ca. Such changes can affect carbon gain and growth of sugar maple trees and seedlings. We applied a 22 factorial arrangement of N and dolomitic limestone containing Ca and Magnesium (Mg) to 12 forest plots in the Catskill Mountain region of NY, USA. To quantify the short-term effects, we measured photosynthetic-light responses of sugar maple mature trees and seedlings two or three times during two summers. We estimated maximum net photosynthesis (An-max) and its related light intensity (PAR at An-max), apparent quantum efficiency (Aqe), and light compensation point (LCP). To quantify the long-term effects, we measured basal area of living mature trees before and 4 and 8 years after treatment applications. Soil and foliar chemistry variables were also measured. Dolomitic limestone increased Ca, Mg, and pH in the soil Oe horizon. Mg was increased in the B horizon when comparing the plots receiving N with those receiving CaMg. In mature trees, foliar Ca and Mg concentrations were higher in the CaMg and N+CaMg plots than in the reference or N plots; foliar Ca concentration was higher in the N+CaMg plots compared with the CaMg plots, foliar Mg was higher in the CaMg plots than the N+CaMg plots; An-max was maximized due to N+CaMg treatment; Aqe decreased by N addition; and PAR at An-max increased by N or CaMg treatments alone, but the increase was maximized by their combination. No treatment effect was detected on basal areas of living mature trees four or eight years after treatment applications. In seedlings, An-max was increased by N+CaMg addition. The reference plots had an open herbaceous layer, but the plots receiving N had a dense monoculture of common woodfern in the forest floor, which can impede seedling survival.},

  abstract = {The present research investigated the response of silver maple (Acer saccharinum L.) to salt treatment. The short- and long-term effects of NaCl and CaCl2 treatments on plant fitness characteristics (growth parameters, leaf chlorophyll content) and biochemical stress-coping mechanisms (proline accumulation as well as enzymatic activities) were examined. We found that the silver maple response to salt stress strictly depended on salt type and dose---calcium chloride was less toxic than sodium chloride, but high concentrations of both salts negatively influenced plant growth. The accumulation of proline, slight changes in the activity of superoxide dismutase and marked changes in catalase and peroxidase activities in the roots and leaves indicated complexity of the plant response. It was also shown that after one year, enzymatic parameters were restabilized, which indicates plant recovery, but the reduced mass of seedlings suggests that one year is not enough to cope with the prolonged cyclic salt stress, both resulting from NaCl and CaCl2 application. Therefore, seedlings of silver maple should be considered as moderately susceptible to salinity. Hence, it is recommended to use silver maple on non-de-iced urban areas, while planting on often de-iced roads should be avoided.},
