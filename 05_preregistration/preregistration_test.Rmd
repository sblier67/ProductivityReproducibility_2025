# Study Information

## Title

```{=html}
<!-- Provide the working title of your study. It may be the same title that you submit for publication of your final manuscript, but it is not a requirement. The title should be a specific and informative description of a project. Vague titles such as 'Fruit fly preregistration plan' are not appropriate.

Example: Effect of sugar on brownie tastiness. -->

`r rmarkdown::metadata$title`

## Description

```{=html}
<!-- Please give a brief description of your study, including some background, the purpose of the of the study, or broad research questions. The description should be no longer than the length of an abstract. It can give some context for the proposed study, but great detail is not needed here for your preregistration.

Example: Though there is strong evidence to suggest that sugar affects taste preferences, the effect has never been demonstrated in brownies. Therefore, we will measure taste preference for four different levels of sugar concentration in a standard brownie recipe to determine if the effect exists in this pastry. -->

In this miniproject, I use the HBR maples dataset
